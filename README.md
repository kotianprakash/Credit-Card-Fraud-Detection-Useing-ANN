# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection - Using ANN



# Objective
*in this project we will use Deep Learning models to see how accurate are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud

*due to the confidentiality of the data , the original feature name is not been provided , it has been kept private

*It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation
 
*the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset
